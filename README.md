# Pain-Relief-from-Analgesic-Drugs

STA104 Project 1
Winter 2021
Professor Amy Kim, Kevin Xu

A term project in which I conduct Nonparametric Statistical analysis using a permutation test (medians), Wilcoxon Rank-Sum test, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to draw inferences of whether there is a difference in pain relief duration between two over the counter analgesic drugs.
I am 95% confident that the true pain relief of Drug A and Drug B are not the same, and that there is evidence that one analgesic over-the-counter drug provides longer pain relief than the other.

Inferences gathered here allow me to conclude that doctors should not prescribe Drug A and Drug B interchangeably to arthritis patients due to the difference in pain relief duration associated with Drug A and Drug B. Additionally, arthritis afflicted patients should not use Drug A or B interchangeably in situations that desired pain relief duration is not identical.
